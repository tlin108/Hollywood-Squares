# Hollywood-Squares
The task was to design and develope a program to play Hollywood Square in a group of five students. We went through all of the different stages of development of a program. We designed the program by UCD, UCT, CD, AD, CRD, CRC, Script, SMD, SD, and SS. We then later develope the program in Java (We have the opinion to do it with GUI or console-based).
